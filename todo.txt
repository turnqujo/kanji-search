* Features, Tasks *
x Finish theme switch control
  x Split into new component
  x Store theme setting in localstorage
x Animations toggle
  x Move transition duration values into vars, place in :root
  x Create "no-animation" mode which sets durations to 0ms
x Font Size selection: break out into component, make global
x Create new view for user settings, include these
x Define styling for the navbar
x Add substring / exact search toggle for meaning
x Set up service worker, make app offline-capable (will need HTTPS)
x Better layout for the Kanji Form
x Hook up the "Clear" button on the Kanji Form

* Refactors, Improvements *
x Stop kanji, conversion, etc. sets from being included in webpack modules
x Cleaner code for applying webworker tasks in the kanji form component
x Clean up the test webworker class, address TODOs
x Refactor SCSS to use more variables; standardize things like element spacing

* Testing (Pre-MVP) *
x Component unit testing
- Cross-browser compatability: Chrome, Firefox, Safari; most used versions
- Device compatability: Linux, Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android; most-used & recent versions
x E2E / workflow testing

* Bugs *
x Sorting by JLPT, Grade, etc. should filter out results which do not have that metric.
- The "All (x)" limit select option is becoming blank after searching for new kanji

* Post-MVP *
- Update webworkers so that they pass back error objects? Maybe just onerror handlers?
- Move interfaces into a global declaration file, instead of importing them all over
- Use Array Buffers for transferring data to and from webworker threads
- Search by Kanji directly
- Change the color variables to not use bootstrap-style semantic colors and instead have just accents
- Add more controls to the kanji form, e.g. grade, jlpt, stroke limiters
- Collapsible fieldsets
- Component structure (smaller, focused components; styled components?)
- Break up typography file (styled components?)
- Loading / working states
- Kanji form state in URL as params, allow for browser search integration
- If performance is good enough, change the search form to work on change instead of on submit
- Rework the Kanji cards into an actual table; move sort options into table headers (desktop only?)
- Add notification system for errors and updates
- Performance testing, especially for webworkers

* Post-MVP Big Features *
- Clock which displays, in Japanese words, the current date and time, with animations which become
  more complex with the magnitude of time change (e.g. minutes have a minor animation, while years
  get a much more involved one)
- Sentence builder, which helps users construct text using kana, romaji, and kanji
- Worksheet constructor (PDF Generator)
